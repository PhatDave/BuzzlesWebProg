    </p>
    <p class="rules">
        The rules are simple.
        The objective is to place skyscrapers in all cells on the grid according to the rules:
    </p>
    <ul class="rulesList">
        <li> The height of the skyscrapers is from 1 to the size of the grid i.e. 1 to 4 for a 4x4 puzzle. </li>
        <li> You cannot have two skyscrapers with the same height on the same row or column. </li>
        <li> The numbers on the sides of the grid indicate how many skyscrapers would you see if you look in the direction of the arrow. </li>
        <li> Place numbers in each cell to indicate the height of the skyscrapers. </li>
    </ul>
